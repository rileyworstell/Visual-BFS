This video shows how to use the program. 
You just need to run the BFS_DFS.py file and then select cells to make them green and be a "Wall".
Then select the buttons on the right for DFS or BFS to watch the algorithms work.

This started off as an implementation of BFS for Maze Solving with a print(grid).

Then it was implemented with Pygame so show a Visual Effect.
